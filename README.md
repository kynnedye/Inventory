# GoodBooks
Search for and save your favorite books to your library. I used local storage so you will be able to actually save your books on your local browser. I also created a reading goal tracker. Set however many books you want for your goal and as you switch the books to read in your library they will be tracked in the progress bar. Created using react and the google books api. https://kynnedye.github.io/GoodBooks/
