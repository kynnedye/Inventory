# inventory
I created this app to help my husband keep inventory of all the beverage products at his work. Originally he was using paper and pen to keep track of everything, so we both came up with the idea to make him an app that helped with this process. With this inventory app you are able to input the item's name and the current count. Also you may input when the item used and everything is stored in firebase. You will also be able to log in so your information will be secure.
